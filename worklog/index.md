# Motivation

<blockquote>
If a day passed without learning something new, you were dead on that day..
<cite>Adam Savage's uncle</cite>
</blockquote>

I am going to keep a diary like worklog about my daily progress. This could be useful if I want to look back, and see what I have accomplished so far. I strongly recommend you to do so :)
