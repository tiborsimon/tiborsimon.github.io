"I am an engineer not a maker. I develop usable products and methods you can count on and not just hack things together and dance when they happen to work. Of course, I had started in that way, indeed, but over time I have realized that there is no point not to do things in the right way."

You should document what you have done, and what you want to achieve. Plan ahead. The extra time will pay back. Always test your work as many way as you can. One of the biggest invention of the modern programming ages the Test Driven Development. This is the only way in my opinion to produce reliable products. Tests give you confidence. Confidence to change or refactor your code. Tests also help you verify the freshly manufactured hardware. A good testing harness leaves no chance for the errors to hide or spread around.

I am tired of the lack of professionalism and passion. In my book you do something because you are passionate about it. You have to do it well, otherwise there is no point of it. I was disappointed in my university. I was disappointed in my jobs.  I was faced with other people incompetency and slothfulness enough now. The only thing I can do is to keep myself on my way, and develop products with care, and hope that my passion will turn others to the right way.
