I am an engineer not a maker. I develop usable products and methods you can count on and not just hack things together and dance when they happen to work. Of course, I had started in that way, indeed, but over time I have realized that there is no point not to do things in the right way.

If you've used any of [my other themes](http://mademistakes.com/work/jekyll-themes/) most of this should be familiar territory...

## What HPSTR brings to the table:

* Responsive templates for post, page, and post index `_layouts`. Looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
* Gracefully degrads in older browsers. Compatible with Internet Explorer 8+ and all modern browsers.  
* Modern and minimal design.
* Sweet animated menu.
* Background image support.
* Readable typography to make your words shine.
* Support for large images to call out your favorite posts.
* Built-in support for Sass courtesy of Jekyll 2.x.
* Optional [Disqus](http://disqus.com) comments.
* Simple and clear permalink structure[^1].
* [Open Graph](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/) and [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards) support for a better social sharing experience.
* Simple [custom 404 page]({{ site.url }}/404.html) to get you started.
* Stylesheets for Pygments and Coderay [syntax highlighting]({{ site.url }}/code-highlighting-post/) to make your code examples look snazzy.
