I am a big fan of the (solarized)[http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized] color theme. I use it wherever I can, and my embedded code snippets on my site aren't an exception. In this article I will demonstrate a method that will turn your (gist's)[gist.github.com] casual style into a much more elegant solarized one.

## The motivation

I always looking for the best possible solutions for getting things done.
