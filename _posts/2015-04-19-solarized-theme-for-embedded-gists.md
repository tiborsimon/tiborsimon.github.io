I am a big fan of the (solarized)[http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized] color theme. I use it wherever I can, and my embedded code snippets on my site aren't an exception. In this article I will demonstrate a method that will turn your (gist's)[gist.github.com] casual style into a much more elegant solarized one.

# The motivation

I was looking for the best way to post source code on my Jekyll based site[^1]. Since the Jekyll sites use markdown or kramdown, it is a pretty reasonable first thought that using the provided syntax highlighting methods will be sufficient to use.

[^1]: If you are not familiar with the story, I have switched from Wordpress to Jekyll. The reason was simple: Wordpress is a fantastic platform with lots and lots of customizations, but it has a major _(and a few smaller)_ drawback: it is dynamic. I.e. it is slow as hell.. It can be attacked and hacked too, it has WYSIWYG editor which sucks, versioning is almost impossible with it. I am going to write a whole article about my switch.
