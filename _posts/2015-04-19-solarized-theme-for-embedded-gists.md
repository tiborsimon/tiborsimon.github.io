I am a big fan of the [solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color theme. I use it wherever I can, and my embedded code snippets on my site aren't an exception. In this article I will demonstrate a method that will turn your [gist's](gist.github.com) normal style into a much more elegant solarized one.

## Early solution - motivation

I was looking for the best way to post source code on my Jekyll based site[^1]. Since the Jekyll sites use [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) or [Kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org), it is a pretty reasonable first thought that using the provided syntax highlighting methods will be sufficient enough to use.

I am using the [HPSTR](https://github.com/mmistakes/hpstr-jekyll-theme) jekyll theme hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). The theme uses Kramdown to process the markdown text, and [Pygments](http://pygments.org) to handle the syntax colorings. To get the desired solarized theme, I just had to create a custom css file.

After a few hours later, I came up with the custom `_pygments.css` file. I started to write this article, and bang.. I randomly tested the article by pushing it to GitHub, and I was sent by a nice letter about page build failure..

<blockquote>
The page build failed with the following error:

The file `assets/css/main.scss` contains syntax errors. For more information, see https://help.github.com/articles/page-build-failed-markdown-errors.

[^1]: If you are not familiar with the story, I have switched from Wordpress to Jekyll. The reason was simple: Wordpress is a fantastic platform with lots and lots of customizations, but it has a major _(and a few smaller)_ drawback: it is dynamic. I.e. it is slow as hell.. It can be attacked and hacked too, it has WYSIWYG editor which sucks, versioning is almost impossible with it. I am going to write a whole article about my switch.
