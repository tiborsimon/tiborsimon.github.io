I am a big fan of the (solarized)[http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized] color theme. I use it wherever I can, and my embedded code snippets on my site aren't an exception. In this article I will demonstrate a method that will turn your (gist's)[gist.github.com] casual style into a much more elegant solarized one.

# The motivation

I was looking for the best way to post source code on my Jekyll based site.
