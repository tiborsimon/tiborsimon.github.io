The easiest way to generate a sine or cosine signal in MATLAB. With this library there are almost infinite ways to describe and generate a sinusoid signals. 

# Generating sinusoid signals

Generating sinusoid signals is often the first step for executing a more complex computation. It should be a routine, but actually it isn't. Many people struggles with it.

## The problem

The equation of a sinusoid signal is a known fact:

However. This equation is only valid in the __continuous time__ domain, therefore without any modification it is useless in the __discrete time__ domain used by every digital machine. You won't be able to create a continuous variable that spans through the duration of the signal from the beginning to the end while taking up every possible value.

Machines work with _discrete time series_ that has a property called __resolution__. Resolution is the link between _continous_ and _discrete_ time domain. This property is implemented with __sampling__. It tells us how many data points were sampled equidistantly from the continuous signal within a time segment. In this way we can represent a continuous signal with discrete data point[^1].

Therefore the _t_ variable in the equation can be represented as a vector of data points. To create such a time vector, you have to choose a sampling interval. 

Let's say you want to get __10 samples per seconds__ _(fs=10Hz)_, and you want to have __20 samples__ in your vector. That also means that your time vector will cover almost __2 seconds__[^2] of continuous time. As you can see, as a constraint, the given duration in continuous time is equivalent with the given number of samples if the sampling frequency is known.

You can test that the `t1` and `t2` vector are exactly the same. Both vector starts from zero and ends at 1.9. Having the time vector we can generate a sinusoid signal with a frequency of 1Hz. This will result 2 periods in the signal:

If we plot the generated signal, we can see, that it is not a sine signal at all. It is a discrete signal, that has values in discrete points as we expected.

This method is one of the 4 main signal generation methods where we link the discrete time signal to the continuous time. Having such a connection between the two domain, the signal can be played back with the computer's _digital to analog converter_.

However. There are other use cases when we don't want to link the __discrete time__ to the __continuous time__, so we don't have to bother with the sampling frequency, and we can generate a time vector from 0 to 1, and pass it to the equation:

{% gist tiborsimon/f7f3d7a521c01022b41d %}

The result will be a 100 sample long sinusoid signal, that contains 3 periods. But be careful. This signal can't be used as the previous one until we specify the sampling frequency.

As you can see, generating sinusoids with these basic methods isn't hard at all. But you __have to think__ about the method, the formulas and the units. This could be a bit time consuming if you have to think about it every time you want to generate a signal..

## Signal generation use cases

In the previous section we discussed the two most basic ways for generating a sinusoid signal. In this section we will go through all the possible signal generation use cases.

| Variable name      | Possible parameters   |
|:------------------:|:----------------------|
| phi                | phase                 |
| A                  | amplitude             |
| f                  | frequency             |
| fs                 | sample rate           |
| T                  | period                |
| dt                 | sample time           |
| L                  | signal duration       |
| N                  | number of periods     |
| n                  | number of samples     |

| Method index | Required parameters | Description  |
|:-------------:|:--------------------|:-------------|
| 1             | n, N                | a signal consisting of _n_ data points with _N_ periods in it
| 2             | f, N, fs            | a signal sampled at _fs_ sampling rate with _N_ periods in it with the frequency _f_
| 3             | f, n, fs            | a signal consisting of _n_ data points sampled at _fs_ sampling rate with the frequency _f_
| 4             | L, n, fs            | a signal consisting of _n_ data points sampled at _fs_ sampling rate having the length of L seconds
| 5             | f, L, fs            | a signal sampled at _fs_ sampling rate with the duration of _L_ seconds with the frequency _f_

We have already discussed __method 1__ and __method 2__ in the previous section.














[^1]: Of course this is a very high level overview of the [sampling theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquistâ€“Shannon_sampling_theorem). There are much more detail how these things really work.

[^2]: Because we have started our time vector from 0 as the first vector point, the remained 19 points wont cover all the 2 seconds time duration but will span until 1.9 seconds _(2s - 1/fs = 1.9s)_.
