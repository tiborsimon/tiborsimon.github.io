The easiest way to generate a sine or cosine signal in MATLAB. With this library there are almost infinite ways to describe and generate a sinusoid signals.

# Generating sinusoids

Generating a sinusoid signal is often the first step for a more complex computations. It should be a routine, but actually it isn't. Many people struggles with it.

### The old way

The equation of a sinusoid signal is a known fact:

However. This equation is only valid in the __continuous time__ domain, therefore without any modification it is useless in the __discrete time__ domain used by every digital machine. You won't be able to create a continuous variable that spans through the duration of the signal from the beginning to the end while taking up every possible value.

Machines work with _discrete time series_ that has a new property called __resolution__. Resolution is the link between _continous_ and _discrete_ time domain. This property is implemented with __sampling__. It tells us how many data points were sampled equidistantly from the continuous signal within a time segment. In this way we can represent a continuous signal with discrete data point[^1].

Therefore the _t_ variable in the equation can be represented as a vector of data points. 

To create such a data point vector, you have to choose a sampling interval. Let's say you want to use 10 samples per seconds (`fs=10Hz`), and you want to have 20 samples in your vector. That also means that your time vector will cover 2 seconds of continuous time. As you can see, the given duration in continuous time is equivalent with the given sampling frequency with the number of samples:

{% highlight css %}
fs = 10;

% continuous duration is known
T = 2;
t1 = [0:1/fs:T-1/fs];

% number of samples are known
N = 20;
t2 = [0:N-1]./fs;
{% endhighlight %}



```
t = [0:1:40];
f = 500;
fs = 8000;
x = sin(2*pi*f/fs*t);
figure(1)
stem(t,x,'r');
```
