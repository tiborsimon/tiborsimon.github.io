The easiest way to generate a sine or cosine signal in MATLAB. With this library there are almost infinite ways to describe and generate a sinusoid signals.

# Generating sinusoids

Generating a sinusoid signal is often the first step for more complex computations. It should be a routine, but actually it isn't. Many people struggles with it.

### The old way

The equation of a sinusoid signal is a known fact:

However. This equation is only valid in the __continuous time__ domain, therefore without any modification it is useless in the __discrete time__ domain used by every digital machine. You won't be able to create a continuous variable that spans through the duration of the signal from the beginning to the end while taking up every possible value.

Machines work with _discrete time series_ that has a new property called __resolution__. Resolution is the link between _continous_ and _discrete_ time domain. This property is implemented with __sampling__. It tells us how many data points were sampled equidistantly from the continuous signal within a time segment. In this way we can represent a continuous signal with discrete data point[^1].

Therefore the _t_ variable in the equation can be represented as a vector of data points.

```
t = [0:1:40];
f = 500;
fs = 8000;
x = sin(2*pi*f/fs*t);
figure(1)
stem(t,x,'r');
```
